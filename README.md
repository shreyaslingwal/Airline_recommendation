# Airline_recommendation

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer would recommend an airline based on various flight-related features and customer feedback. The goal is to assist airlines in improving customer satisfaction by identifying key factors influencing positive recommendations.

📁 Project Structure
Airline_recommendation.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the end-to-end pipeline—from data exploration and preprocessing to model building, evaluation, and conclusion.

📊 Dataset
Dataset Link-https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sSZGUqWpv3NfSdOMxC070fAragKnRMMS/view?usp=sharing
The dataset includes airline passenger feedback data with features such as:

customer_review,traveller_type ,overall	,seat_comfort	,cabin_service	,food_bev,	entertainment	,ground_service,	value_for_money 


Target: Likelihood of recommending the airline

The target variable is binary: 0 = Not Recommended(NO), 1 = Recommended(YES)

✅ Key Findings
SVC and XGBoost performed best, achieving the highest accuracy and F1-score.
